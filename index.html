                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In May Jimmy Hillraker hung himself with an extension cord from the center rafter of his family’s barn. The barn had been built in 1857 by Jimmy’s great-great-grandfather, his three brothers, his uncle, and a team of Amish laborers up from the Pennsylvania border. It was fourteen yards wide and almost twenty-eight long, made with oak framing and hemlock boards that had turned black over the decades. They hadn’t used a single nail in all of the framing, instead using large pegs that were soaked in beeswax and driven into holes they drilled by hand. No one was sure how Jimmy had got himself to the center rafter, almost fifty feet from the ground. He was twenty-three years old.

                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In June, Samantha Morrissey was found dead of an opioid overdose down on Chambers Hollows Road, a heavily wooded dead-end in the south of the county where she lived in a rented trailer with her boyfriend and two-year-old son. Her father found her body in the morning when he had stopped by with coffee on his way to work, something he did once a week. The boyfriend later told police that he had left the evening before after they had a fight and stayed the night at a friend’s. Samantha’s father found the couple’s son hiding in the bathtub, scared as a puppy in a thunderstorm. Samantha would have turned twenty-one exactly one week after her overdose.

                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Also in June, John Groat shot his little brother Jamie in the stomach with an old .30-30 lever action rifle that had belonged to their grandfather. John alleged that he and his brother had been high and drunk, goofing around, and that the shooting was an accident, yet there were no other witnesses to corroborate this story. Jamie had been unresponsive at the scene and died slowly three weeks later at the Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo, New York. John attempted suicide in his holding cell with a plastic spoon he’d sharpened on the concrete floor, but a guard found him and saved his life. He was transferred to a psychiatric facility to await trial. Jamie Groat was twenty-two and John twenty-six.

                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Towards the end of August, Talin Roberts overdosed in his mother’s house near Parker’s Corners, about a ten-mile drive from the town of Chowanga. He had had prior issues with addiction and law enforcement and had recently come back from a court-mandated stint in rehab the weekend of Independence Day. The coroner concluded that the overdose had been caused by Talin’s reduced tolerance since his sobriety. He had been twenty-four years old.

                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;On the evening of August 31st and morning of September 1st, Jody Hillraker—Jimmy Hillraker’s second cousin—took her two small children, Doris, two, and Sam, four, and drove them out to Point Heron on the Lake, about fifty miles from her home. She left the two children at a bench in the small park with a blanket for each and a cooler of food. Once she got the children asleep, she went back to her car and drove away. Her whereabouts remain unknown. An elderly man found the children the next morning during his routine jog through the park down to the beach. Jody Hillraker was only eighteen years old.

                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In September, Jared Hewlitt of the prosperous Hewlitt Family Farms and former champion high school running back visited his family from Chicago where he worked as a project manager at an accounting firm. On the last night of his visit, he went out into his family’s orchard with a 12-gauge shotgun and shot himself in the head. His father and a farm employee found his body after searching the large orchard for over an hour on ATVs. His mother found a suicide note that listed his reasons: debt, depression, and alcoholism. The suicide came as a shock to the community and during Jared’s wake in the town of Cooper Creek, the line of mourners reached from the door of the church to the lake, almost a mile and a half. Jared Hewlitt was thirty years old.

                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;October arrived with two overdoses, one a high school student at Cooper Creek High, Shayna Bartlett, and the other a cook at a diner one county over, Michael Thomlinson. Shayna, sixteen, had been found unresponsive on her bedroom floor when her mother had tried to wake her for school. She had been a cheerleader, leading scorer for the junior varsity basketball team, and had planned on going to Syracuse University after she graduated. Michael Thomlinson was found by his grandmother in his trailer when she came over for their weekly visit. Usually she and Michael would sit for at least two hours talking over cups of tea. Both overdoses had been unexpected by the families and those who were close to the deceased. But the coroner had determined that both were habitual heroin users for at least six months: Michael intravenously, Shayna nasally.

                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;On the first of November, after Chucky Smith crashed his truck into a tree killing himself and his fiancé Sally Maines who had gone to school with her granddaughter Lucy, Billie Dudek began recording the deaths in a marble composition book. She found the grade school-style book fitting considering the ages of all the deceased.

                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;At times she thinks it’s the end of the world. Other times she thinks she’s just old. Or crazy. Maybe it’s all three.

                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Tuesday after the deaths of Sally Maines and Chucky Smith, Billie sits in the twilit morning at her kitchen table, the composition book open before her. There’s Sally Maines and below her Chucky Smith—alphabetical since there was no mention of who had died in the crash first. She pictures herself sitting there: bald-headed, eighty-one years old, sitting over coffee and a children’s composition book. Alone. It gives her a shiver. She tugs the house-robe tighter around her chest and takes up her coffee.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She’ll have to put the composition book away soon. Julito will be here in an hour or so. The timing is never exact with him. It’s as if he were a repairman and she a busted washing machine—<em>I’ll be there between eight and noon, ma’am</em>. But she knows he’ll come soon. Can almost feel it now.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She looks out the window to her left. Where she usually sees the yard and the woods beyond, now she sees only grayed-out glass. It’s taking the yellow incandescent light from the kitchen and the murk from the sky outside and producing an opaque mirror. She stares at her washed-out reflection, like something out of a horror movie.
                        </p>
                        <p class="center"><strong>&#8226;</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Two thousand and fifteen, she thinks. Who would’ve thought it?
                        </p>
                        <p class="center"><strong>&#8226;</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The composition book just appeared. Funny how things do that. You need something and all of a sudden, there it is.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After she’d heard about Chucky Smith and Sally Maines she’d went to her bedroom like a sleepwalker and was drawn to her desk. She began digging around in the main drawer, unsure of what she was looking for. Then there it was. Under forgotten mail, strands of her shed hair, pens of every color and kind, a tumbleweed of paperclips and staples and rubber bands, and a stack of index cards fused into a solid block, there was the composition book. It had been there so long it was stuck to the bottom of the drawer. When she plucked it out it made a ripping sound that startled her. There was nothing written inside of it and no pages torn out. It smelled of dust, mildew, and something vaguely human, like dry sweat.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Maybe she had bought it for Lucy and forgotten to give it to her? Or maybe she’d bought it for one of her projects? One of the many projects that would piece together so well in her head but fragment once they touched the reality around her.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But now the composition book had a use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And now there was Sally Maines inside of it, the photo of her from the paper glued in with the glue stick she also found in the drawer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Billie knew the Maineses, or at least had known them and now knew of them. Sally’s grandmother was a few years under her in school. At that time her name had been Ollecks, before she married the farm boy Jordy Maines whose BO was so strong it cut through even the smell of cow that he’d bring with him to school every morning. She hadn’t known their son Timothy very well, nor his wife Cathy. Where she’d say hello and even chat with Sally’s grandmother, she’d only nod at Tim and Cathy. But she remembers seeing the little toe-headed Sally.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She would pick up Lucy from kindergarten, twenty years ago it must be now. Pulling up to the brick building and waiting outside with the other parents, feeling self-conscious of being the oldest person there, the dong of the clips hitting the tall aluminum flagpole nearby like a second hand. Then out would come the kids, marching with their little packs and their little lunch boxes dangling from their little hands. And there would be Lucy, searching for Billie among the youthful parents. And there’d be Sally too, sticking out with her long white-blonde hair, so white it looked like someone had erased that part of the world around her head. Billie remembers thinking, remembering, that the little Maines girl looks like she did when she was that age. If she went through her photo albums now, she could probably find a picture of herself with the same white hair that eventually went to brown then to gray then to gone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But now Sally Maines was gone. Now, twenty years later, that little toe-headed girl was dead. Now she is in Billie’s book.
                        </p>
                        <p class="center"><strong>&#8226;</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She hides the book under her bed inside the box of old photo albums. It’s a place no one will look, she thinks. Even though there really is no one to look. Aside from the mailman that drives up and delivers her mail by hand—a courtesy he started after her seventieth birthday—no one else comes to the house except her caregiver Julito.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It’s him she hides the book from, though she’s not sure why. He comes a few hours a day, Sunday through Friday, and never says much aside from “Yes.” He wouldn’t ask her about the book. Surely, she doesn’t have to hide it. Nor does she have to pretend that everything is all right, that she and the town and the county and the world are just peachy. But she does for him. She tries to.
